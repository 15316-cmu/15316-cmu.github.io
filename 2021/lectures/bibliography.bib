  abstract = {In this thesis we examine the possibility of automatically constructing
        the program specification from an implementation, both from a theoretical
        perspective and as a practical approach with a sequent calculus.
        As a setting for program specifications we choose dynamic logic for
        the Java programming language. We show that---despite the undecidable
        nature of program analysis---the strongest specification of any program
        can always be constructed algorithmically. Further we outline a practical
        approach embedded into a sequent calculus for dynamic logic and with
        a higher focus on readability. Therefor, the central aspect of describing
        unbounded state changes incorporates the concept of modifies lists
        for expressing the modifiable portion of the state space. The underlying
        deductions are carried out by the theorem prover of the KeY System.},

  abstract = {With the goal of this thesis being to create a dynamic logic for object-oriented
        languages, ODL is developed along with a sound and relatively complete
        calculus. The dynamic logic contains only the absolute logical essentials
        of object-orientation, yet still allows a ``natural'' representation
        of all other features of common object-oriented programming languages.
        ODL is an extension of a dynamic logic for imperative While programs
        by function modification and dynamic type checks. A generalisation
        of substitutions, called updates, constitute the central technical
        device for dealing with object aliasing arising from function modification
        and for retaining a manageable calculus in practical application
        scenarios. Further, object enumerators realise object creation in
        a natural yet powerful way. Finally, completeness is proven relative
        to first-order arithmetic. Along with the soundness result, this
        proof constitutes the central part of this thesis and even copes
        with states containing uncomputable functions.},

      We combine first-order dynamic logic for reasoning about

      Our logic supports verification of hybrid programs with
      first-order definable flows and provides a uniform treatment of
      discrete and continuous evolution.  For our combined logic, we
      generalise the semantics of dynamic modalities to refer to

      this gives a conservative extension of dynamic logic.  On this
      basis, we provide a modular verification calculus that reduces
      correctness of temporal behaviour of hybrid systems to
      non-temporal reasoning.  Using this calculus, we analyse safety
      invariants in a train control system and symbolically synthesise
      parametric safety constraints.

      transitions and continuous evolutions along differential
      equations.  With the goal of developing a theoretical and
      practical foundation for deductive verification of hybrid
      systems, we introduce a dynamic logic for hybrid programs, which
      is a program notation for hybrid systems.  As a verification
      technique that is suitable for automation, we introduce a free
      variable proof calculus with a novel combination of real-valued
      free variables and Skolemisation for lifting quantifier
      elimination for real arithmetic to dynamic logic.  The calculus
      is compositional, i.e., it reduces properties of hybrid programs
      to properties of their parts.  Our main result proves that this
      calculus axiomatises the transition behaviour of hybrid systems
      completely relative to differential equations.  In a case study
      with cooperating traffic agents of the European Train Control
      System, we further show that our calculus is well-suited for
      verifying realistic hybrid systems with parametric system
      dynamics.

      KeYmaera is a hybrid verification tool for hybrid systems that
      combines deductive, real algebraic, and computer algebraic
      prover technologies.  It is an automated and interactive theorem
      prover for a natural specification and verification logic for
      hybrid systems.  KeYmaera supports differential dynamic logic,
      which is a real-valued first-order dynamic logic for hybrid
      programs, a program notation for hybrid automata.  For
      automating the verification process, KeYmaera implements a
      generalized free-variable sequent calculus and automatic proof
      strategies that decompose the hybrid system specification
      symbolically.  To overcome the complexity of real arithmetic, we
      integrate real quantifier elimination following an iterative
      background closure strategy.  Our tool is particularly suitable

      successfully for verifying collision avoidance in case studies

      Recently, there has been considerable interest in the use of Model
      Checking for Systems Biology. Unfortunately, the state space of
      stochastic biological models is often too large for classical Model
      Checking techniques. For these models, a statistical approach to Model
      Checking has been shown to be an effective alternative. Extending our
      earlier work, we present the first algorithm for performing statistical
      Model Checking using Bayesian Sequential Hypothesis Testing. We show
      that our Bayesian approach outperforms current statistical Model
      Checking techniques, which rely on tests from Classical (aka
      Frequentist) statistics, by requiring fewer system simulations. Another
      advantage of our approach is the ability to incorporate prior Biological
      knowledge about the model being verified. We demonstrate our algorithm
      on a variety of models from the Systems Biology literature and show that
      it enables faster verification than state-of-the-art techniques, even
      when no prior knowledge is available.

      Cyberphysical system technology has an important share in modern
      intelligent transportation systems, including next generation
      flight, rail, and car control. This control technology is
      intended to help improve performance objectives like throughput
      and improve overall system safety. To ensure that these
      transportation systems operate correctly, new analysis
      techniques are needed that consider physical movement combined
      with computational control to establish properties like
      collision freedom. Logic-based analysis can verify the correct
      functioning of these cyberphysical systems.}

      Aircraft collision avoidance maneuvers are important and complex
      applications. Curved flight exhibits nontrivial continuous behavior. In
      combination with the control choices during air traffic maneuvers, this
      yields hybrid systems with challenging interactions of discrete and
      continuous dynamics. As a case study illustrating the use of a new proof
      assistant for a logic for nonlinear hybrid systems, we analyze collision
      freedom of roundabout maneuvers in air traffic control, where
      appropriate curved flight, good timing, and compatible maneuvering are
      crucial for guaranteeing safe spatial separation of aircraft throughout
      their flight. We show that formal verification of hybrid systems can
      scale to curved flight maneuvers required in aircraft control
      applications. We introduce a fully flyable variant of the roundabout
      collision avoidance maneuver and verify safety properties by
      compositional verification.}

        Complex physical systems have several degrees of freedom. They only
        work correctly when their control parameters obey corresponding
        constraints. Based on the informal specification of the European Train
        Control System (ETCS), we design a controller for its cooperation
        protocol. For its free parameters, we successively identify
        constraints that are required to ensure collision freedom. We formally
        prove the parameter constraints to be sharp by characterizing them
        equivalently in terms of reachability properties of the hybrid system
        dynamics. Using our deductive verification tool KeYmaera, we formally
        verify controllability, safety, liveness, and reactivity properties of
        the ETCS protocol that entail collision freedom. We prove that the
        ETCS protocol remains correct even in the presence of perturbation by
        disturbances in the dynamics. We verify that safety is preserved when

        We address the problem of model checking stochastic systems,
        i.e. checking whether a stochastic system satisfies a certain
        temporal property with a probability greater (or smaller) than a
        fixed threshold. In particular, we present a novel Statistical
        Model Checking (SMC) approach based on Bayesian statistics. We show
        that our approach is feasible for hybrid systems with stochastic
        transitions, a generalization of Simulink/Stateflow models.
        Standard approaches to stochastic (discrete) systems require
        numerical solutions for large optimization problems and quickly
        become infeasible with larger state spaces. Generalizations of
        these techniques to hybrid systems with stochastic effects are even
        more challenging. The SMC approach was pioneered by Younes and
        Simmons in the discrete and non-Bayesian case. It solves the
        verification problem by combining randomized sampling of system
        traces (which is very efficient for Simulink/Stateflow) with
        hypothesis testing or estimation. We believe SMC is essential for
        scaling up to large Stateflow/Simulink models. While the answer to
        the verification problem is not guaranteed to be correct, we prove
        that Bayesian SMC can make the probability of giving a wrong answer
        arbitrarily small. The advantage is that answers can usually be
        obtained much faster than with standard, exhaustive model checking
        techniques. We apply our Bayesian SMC approach to a representative
        example of stochastic discrete-time hybrid system models in
        Stateflow/Simulink: a fuel control system featuring hybrid behavior
        and fault tolerance. We show that our technique enables faster
        verification than state-of-the-art statistical techniques, while
        retaining the same error bounds. We emphasize that Bayesian SMC is
        by no means restricted to Stateflow/Simulink models: we have in
        fact successfully applied it to very large stochastic models from
        Systems Biology.

        appearance of aircraft during an ongoing collision avoidance
        maneuver is a longstanding and essentially unsolved problem.
        The resulting systems are not hybrid systems and their state

        systems with nontrivial continuous and discrete dynamics in
        distributed state spaces whose dimension and topology changes

    Car safety measures can be most effective when the cars on
    a street coordinate their control actions using
    distributed cooperative control. While each car optimizes
    its navigation planning locally to ensure the driver
    reaches his destination, all cars coordinate their actions
    in a distributed way in order to minimize the risk of
    safety hazards and collisions. These systems control the
    physical aspects of car movement using cyber technologies
    like local and remote sensor data and distributed V2V and
    V2I communication. They are thus cyber-physical systems.
    In this paper, we consider a distributed car control
    system that is inspired by the ambitions of the California
    PATH project, the CICAS system, SAFESPOT and PReVENT
    initiatives. We develop a formal model of a distributed
    car control system in which every car is controlled by
    adaptive cruise control. One of the major technical
    difficulties is that faithful models of distributed car
    control have both distributed systems and hybrid systems
    dynamics. They form distributed hybrid systems, which
    makes them very challenging for verification. In a formal
    proof system, we verify that the control model satisfies
    its main safety objective and guarantees collision freedom
    for arbitrarily many cars driving on a street, even if new
    cars enter the lane from on-ramps or multi-lane streets.
    The system we present is in many ways one of the most
    complicated cyber-physical systems that has ever been
    fully verified formally.

      It has been a tradition for IEEE Intelligent Systems to acknowledge 10
      accomplished AI researchers in their early careers every two years as
      "AI's 10 to Watch." These researchers have all completed their doctoral
      work in the past couple of years. A wide range of senior AI researchers
      across the world, including primarily academics but also industry
      researchers, were contacted to nominate young star researchers in all
      disciplines of AI. A committee comprising members of our advisory and
      editorial boards reviewed these nominations and unanimously agreed on
      the top 10, whom we present to you in this special section. We would
      like to congratulate these young researchers for winning this special
      recognition. We are proud to present this glimpse of the future of AI
      and the practicing AI researchers who promise to be the leaders of the
      field.

    Logic is a powerful tool for analyzing and verifying systems,
    including programs, discrete systems, real-time systems, hybrid
    systems, and distributed systems. Some applications also have a
    stochastic behavior, however, either because of fundamental
    properties of nature, uncertain environments, or simplifications to
    overcome complexity. Discrete probabilistic systems have been
    studied using logic. But logic has been chronically underdeveloped
    in the context of stochastic hybrid systems, i.e., systems with
    interacting discrete, continuous, and stochastic dynamics. We aim
    at overcoming this deficiency and introduce a dynamic logic for
    stochastic hybrid systems. Our results indicate that logic is a
    promising tool for understanding stochastic hybrid systems and can
    help taming some of their complexity. We introduce a compositional
    model for stochastic hybrid systems. We prove adaptivity, cadlag,
    and Markov time properties, and prove that the semantics of our
    logic is measurable. We present compositional proof rules,
    including rules for stochastic differential equations, and prove
    soundness.

      Hybrid systems are models for complex physical systems and
      have become a widely used concept for understanding their
      behavior. Many applications are safety-critical, including
      car, railway, and air traffic control, robotics,
      physical-chemical process control, and biomedical devices.
      Hybrid systems analysis studies how we can build computerised
      controllers for physical systems which are guaranteed to meet
      their design goals. The continuous dynamics of hybrid systems
      can be modeled by differential equations, the discrete
      dynamics by a combination of discrete state-transitions and
      conditional execution. The discrete and continuous dynamics
      interact to form hybrid systems, which makes them quite
      challenging for verification.
      
       In this tutorial, we survey state-of-the-art verification
      techniques for hybrid systems. In particular, we focus on a
      coherent logical approach for systematic hybrid systems
      analysis. We survey theory, practice, and applications, and
      show how hybrid systems can be verified in the hybrid systems
      verification tool KeYmaera. KeYmaera has been used
      successfully to verify safety, reactivity, controllability,
      and liveness properties, including collision freedom in air
      traffic, car, and railway control systems. It has also been
      used to verify properties of electrical circuits.

    Intelligent vehicle systems have interesting prospects for
    solving inefficiencies and risks in ground transportation,
    e.g., by making cars aware of their environment and
    regulating speed intelligently. If the computer control
    technology reacts fast enough, intelligent control can be
    used to increase the density of cars on the streets. The
    technology may also help prevent crashes at intersections,
    which cost the US $97 Billion in the year 2000. The
    crucial prerequisite for intelligent vehicle control,
    however, is that it must be correct, for it may otherwise
    do more harm than good. Formal verification techniques
    provide the best reliability guarantees but have had
    difficulties in the past with scaling to such complex
    systems. We report our successes with a logical approach
    to hybrid systems verification, which can capture discrete
    control decisions and continuous driving dynamics. We
    present a model for the interaction of two cars and a
    traffic light at a two lane intersection and verify with a
    formal proof that our system always ensures collision
    freedom and that our controller always prevents cars from
    running red lights.

    The biggest challenge in hybrid systems verification is the
    handling of differential equations. Because computable
    closed-form solutions only exist for very simple differential
    equations, proof certificates have been proposed for more
    scalable verification. Search procedures for these proof
    certificates are still rather ad-hoc, though, because the
    problem structure is only understood poorly. We investigate
    differential invariants, which define an induction principle for
    differential equations and which can be checked for invariance
    along a differential equation just by using their differential
    structure, without having to solve them. We study the structural
    properties of differential invariants. To analyze trade-offs for
    proof search complexity, we identify more than a dozen relations
    between several classes of differential invariants and compare
    their deductive power. As our main results, we analyze the
    deductive power of differential cuts and the deductive power of
    differential invariants with auxiliary differential variables.
    We refute the differential cut elimination hypothesis and show
    that, unlike standard cuts, differential cuts are fundamental
    proof principles that strictly increase the deductive power. We
    also prove that the deductive power increases further when
    adding auxiliary differential variables to the dynamics.

    We study the logic of dynamical systems, that is, logics and
    proof principles for properties of dynamical systems. Dynamical
    systems are mathematical models describing how the state of a
    system evolves over time. They are important in modeling and
    understanding many applications, including embedded systems and
    cyber-physical systems. In discrete dynamical systems, the
    state evolves in discrete steps, one step at a time, as
    described by a difference equation or discrete state transition
    relation. In continuous dynamical systems, the state evolves
    continuously along a function, typically described by a
    differential equation. Hybrid dynamical systems or hybrid
    systems combine both discrete and continuous dynamics.
    
     This is a brief survey of differential dynamic logic for
    specifying and verifying properties of hybrid systems. We
    explain hybrid system models, differential dynamic logic, its
    semantics, and its axiomatization for proving logical formulas
    about hybrid systems. We study differential invariants, i.e.,
    induction principles for differential equations. We briefly
    survey theoretical results, including soundness and
    completeness and deductive power. Differential dynamic logic
    has been implemented in automatic and interactive theorem
    provers and has been used successfully to verify
    safety-critical applications in automotive, aviation, railway,
    robotics, and analogue electrical circuits.

    Hybrid systems are a fusion of continuous dynamical systems
    and discrete dynamical systems. They freely combine dynamical
    features from both worlds. For that reason, it has often been
    claimed that hybrid systems are more challenging than
    continuous dynamical systems and than discrete systems. We now
    show that, proof-theoretically, this is not the case. We
    present a complete proof-theoretical alignment that
    interreduces the discrete dynamics and the continuous dynamics
    of hybrid systems. We give a sound and complete axiomatization
    of hybrid systems relative to continuous dynamical systems and
    a sound and complete axiomatization of hybrid systems relative
    to discrete dynamical systems. Thanks to our axiomatization,
    proving properties of hybrid systems is exactly the same as
    proving properties of continuous dynamical systems and again,
    exactly the same as proving properties of discrete dynamical
    systems. This fundamental cornerstone sheds light on the
    nature of hybridness and enables flexible and provably perfect
    combinations of discrete reasoning with continuous reasoning
    that lift to all aspects of hybrid systems and their

  abstract  = {
    We address a fundamental mismatch between the combinations of
    dynamics that occur in cyber-physical systems and the limited
    kinds of dynamics supported in analysis. Modern applications
    combine communication, computation, and control. They may even
    form dynamic distributed networks, where neither structure nor
    dimension stay the same while the system follows hybrid
    dynamics, i.e., mixed discrete and continuous dynamics.
    
     We provide the logical foundations for closing this analytic
    gap. We develop a formal model for distributed hybrid systems.
    It combines quantified differential equations with quantified
    assignments and dynamic dimensionality-changes. We introduce a
    dynamic logic for verifying distributed hybrid systems and
    present a proof calculus for this logic. This is the first
    formal verification approach for distributed hybrid systems. We
    prove that our calculus is a sound and complete axiomatization
    of the behavior of distributed hybrid systems relative to
    quantified differential equations. In our calculus we have
    proven collision freedom in distributed car control even when an
    unbounded number of new cars may appear dynamically on the road.

      Hybrid systems, i.e., dynamical systems combining discrete
      and continuous dynamics, have a complete axiomatization in
      differential dynamic logic relative to differential
      equations. Differential invariants are a natural induction
      principle for proving properties of the remaining
      differential equations. We study the equational case of
      differential invariants using a differential operator view.
      We relate differential invariants to Lie's seminal work and
      explain important structural properties resulting from this
      view. Finally, we study the connection of differential
      invariants with partial differential equations in the
      context of the inverse characteristic method for computing
      differential invariants.

        We address the problem of model checking stochastic systems, i.e., checking whether a stochastic system satisfies a certain temporal property with a probability greater (or smaller) than a fixed threshold. In particular, we present a Statistical Model Checking (SMC) approach based on Bayesian statistics. We show that our approach is feasible for a certain class of hybrid systems with stochastic transitions, a generalization of Simulink/Stateflow models. Standard approaches to stochastic discrete systems require numerical solutions for large optimization problems and quickly become infeasible with larger state spaces. Generalizations of these techniques to hybrid systems with stochastic effects are even more challenging. The SMC approach was pioneered by Younes and Simmons in the discrete and non-Bayesian case. It solves the verification problem by combining randomized sampling of system traces (which is very efficient for Simulink/Stateflow) with hypothesis testing (i.e., testing against a probability threshold) or estimation (i.e., computing with high probability a value close to the true probability). We believe SMC is essential for scaling up to large Stateflow/Simulink models. While the answer to the verification problem is not guaranteed to be correct, we prove that Bayesian SMC can make the probability of giving a wrong answer arbitrarily small. The advantage is that answers can usually be obtained much faster than with standard, exhaustive model checking techniques. We apply our Bayesian SMC approach to a representative example of stochastic discrete-time hybrid system models in Stateflow/Simulink: a fuel control system featuring hybrid behavior and fault tolerance. We show that our technique enables faster verification than state-of-the-art statistical techniques. We emphasize that Bayesian SMC is by no means restricted to Stateflow/Simulink models. It is in principle applicable to a variety of stochastic models from other domains, e.g., systems biology.

    We consider an adaptive cruise control system in which control decisions are made based on position and velocity information received from other vehicles via V2V wireless communication. If the vehicles follow each other at a close distance, they have better wireless reception but collisions may occur when a follower car does not receive notice about the decelerations of the leader car fast enough to react before it is too late. If the vehicles are farther apart, they would have a bigger safety margin, but the wireless communication drops out more often, so that the follower car no longer receives what the leader car is doing. In order to guarantee safety, such a system must return control to the driver if it does not receive an update from a nearby vehicle within some timeout period. The value of this timeout parameter encodes a tradeoff between the likelihood that an update is received and the maximum safe acceleration. Combining formal verification techniques for hybrid systems with a wireless communication model, we analyze how the expected efficiency of a provably-safe adaptive cruise control system is affected by the value of this timeout.

    We address the problem how high-fidelity verification results about the hybrid systems dynamics of cyber-physical flow systems can be provided at the scale of large (traffic) networks without prohibitive analytic cost. We propose the use of contracts for traffic flow components concisely capturing the conditions for a safe operation in the context of a traffic network. This reduces the analysis of flows in the full traffic network to simple arithmetic checks of the local compatibility of the traffic component contracts, while retaining higher-fidelity correctness guarantees of the global hybrid systems models that inherits from correct contracts of the hybrid system components. We evaluate our approach in a case study of a modular traffic network and a prototypical implementation in a model-based analysis and design tool for traffic flow networks.

  abstract = {\emph{Cyber-physical systems} (CPS) combine cyber aspects such as communication and computer control with physical aspects such as movement in space, which arise frequently in many safety-critical application domains, including aviation, automotive, railway, and robotics. But how can we ensure that these systems are guaranteed to meet their design goals, e.g., that an aircraft will not crash into another one?

This paper highlights some of the most fascinating aspects of cyber-physical systems and their dynamical systems models, such as hybrid systems that combine discrete transitions and continuous evolution along differential equations. Because of the impact that they can have on the real world, CPSs deserve proof as safety evidence.

\emph{Multi-dynamical systems} understand complex systems as a combination of multiple elementary dynamical aspects, which makes them natural mathematical models for CPS, since they tame their complexity by compositionality.
The family of \emph{differential dynamic logics} achieves this compositionality by providing compositional logics, programming languages, and reasoning principles for CPS.
Differential dynamic logics, as implemented in the theorem prover KeYmaera X, have been instrumental in verifying many applications, including the Airborne Collision Avoidance System ACAS X, the European Train Control System ETCS, automotive systems, mobile robot navigation, and a surgical robot system for skull-base surgery. This combination of strong theoretical foundations with practical theorem proving challenges and relevant applications makes \emph{Logic for CPS} an ideal area for compelling and rewarding research.

    We introduce differential refinement logic (dRL), a logic with first-class support for refinement relations on hybrid systems, and a proof calculus for verifying such relations. dRL simultaneously solves several seemingly different challenges common in theorem proving for hybrid systems: 1. When hybrid systems are complicated, it is useful to prove properties about simpler and related subsystems before tackling the system as a whole. 2. Some models of hybrid systems can be implementation-specific. Verification can be aided by abstracting the system down to the core components necessary for safety, but only if the relations between the abstraction and the original system can be guaranteed. 3. One approach to taming the complexities of hybrid systems is to start with a simplified version of the system and iteratively expand it. However, this approach can be costly, since every iteration has to be proved safe from scratch, unless refinement relations can be leveraged in the proof. 4. When proofs become large, it is difficult to maintain a modular or comprehensible proof structure. By using a refinement relation to arrange proofs hierarchically according to the structure of natural subsystems, we can increase the readability and modularity of the resulting proof. dRL extends an existing specification and verification language for hybrid systems (differential dynamic logic, dL) by adding a refinement relation to directly compare hybrid systems. This paper gives a syntax, semantics, and proof calculus for dRL. We demonstrate its usefulness with examples where using refinement results in easier and better-structured proofs.

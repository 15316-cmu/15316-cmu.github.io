    <h3>Late Policy</h3>

    <p class="text-danger"> You have a total of 5 late days to use throughout
    the semester on the five written homeworks, where you may not use more than
    2 days on any given homework </p>

    <p class="text-danger"> Each team has a total of 3 late days
    to use throughout the semester on the three labs, where you may not
    use more than 2 days on any given lab. </p>

      <h3>Written Homeworks</h3>

      <p> Homeworks are written assignments designed to help you master the
      theoretical concepts in this course. They will include things like logic
      proofs and describing vulnerabilities in formally described security
      systems.  </p>

      <p class="text-danger"> Written homeworks must be done individually.
      Collaboration is regulated by the whiteboard policy: you can bounce ideas
      about a homework with other students, but when it comes to typing it down
      for submission, you are on your own. You are not allowed to use notes,
      files, pictures, etc., from any previous discussion nor previous versions
      of this course. If you use unrelated web resources, you must explicitly
      cite them.</p>

      <p> Unless otherwise stated, all homeworks are due at 11:59pm on the date
      marked on the handout. Also check the announcements in Piazza for deadline
      updates, in case extensions are granted. All homework should be submitted
      through Gradescope, please notify the course staff if you have not already
      received an email to enroll in the relevant Gradescope instance. </p>

      <p> In order to submit on Gradescope, your written homework will need to
      be in PDF format. You are highly encouraged to typeset your solutions in
      LaTeX, and you will find appropriate templates for each assignment
      below. Your graders strongly prefer LaTeX-typeset solutions, as your work
      is much more likely to be clear and legible, as well as consistent with
      the formatting they expect to see. We recognize that certain types of
      answers, such as those that involve graphical figures or structured
      formatting, can be difficult or tedious to typeset. In those cases, the
      template will sometimes give an example in the comments that you are
      encouraged to emulate, but it is fine to scan a handwritten solution to
      include in your latex code as a graphic.  </p>

      <h3>Labs</h3>

      <p> Labs are programming assignments designed to give you hands on
      experience applying the concepts learned in this course. You will be
      writing and testing code and security policies.  Labs may also involve a
      written part, to be handed in separately on Gradescope. </p>

      <p class="text-danger"> Labs may be done in pairs (strongly encouraged) or
      individually.  If you choose to work with a partner, you should submit
      only one solution as a group on Gradescope.  You should not collaborate
      with others outside your group---the whiteboard policy only applies to the
      written homework assignments.  You are not allowed to use any materials
      from labs in previous versions of this course. If you use unrelated web
      resources, you must explicitly cite them.</p>

      <p> As with homeworks, all labs are due at 11:59pm on the date marked on
      the handout. Labs should also be submitted on Gradescope.  </p>

      <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

      <p> You are expected to comply with the <a
      href="https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html">university
      policy on academic integrity</a> for exams, and for written homeworks and
      labs as specified above (see also <a
      href="https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/">The Word</a> and <a
      href="https://www.cmu.edu/academic-integrity/understanding/cmu.html">Understanding
      Academic Integrity</a>).  </p>

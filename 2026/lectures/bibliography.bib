abstract="Information-flow security type systems ensure confidentiality by enforcing noninterference: a program cannot leak private data to public channels. However, in practice, programs need to selectively declassify information about private data. Several approaches have provided a notion of relaxed noninterference supporting selective and expressive declassification while retaining a formal security property. The labels-as-functions approach provides relaxed noninterference by means of declassification policies expressed as functions. The labels-as-types approach expresses declassification policies using type abstraction and faceted types, a pair of types representing the secret and public facets of values. The original proposal of labels-as-types is formulated in an object-oriented setting where type abstraction is realized by subtyping. The object-oriented approach however suffers from limitations due to its receiver-centric paradigm.",

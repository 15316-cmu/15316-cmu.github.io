      <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p class="text-justify">
      Security and privacy issues in computer systems continue to be a
      pervasive issue in technology and society. Understanding the security
      and privacy needs of software, and being able to rigorously demonstrate
      that those needs are met, is key to eliminating vulnerabilities that
      cause these issues. Students who take this course will learn the
      principles needed to make these assurances about software, and some of
      the key strategies used to make sure that they are correctly implemented
      in practice. Topics include: policy models and mechanisms for
      confidentiality, integrity, and availability, language-based techniques
      for detecting and preventing security threats, mechanisms for enforcing
      privacy guarantees, and the interaction between software and underlying
      systems that can give rise to practical security threats. Students will
      also gain experience applying many of these techniques to write code
      that is secure by construction.
    </p>

    <h3>Learning goals</h3>

    <p class="text-justify">
      The philosophy underpinning this course seeks to bridge formal
      principles with their practical application to enhancing security and
      privacy in software implementations. On the “principles” side, there are
      several key learning objectives.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify">
      <b>Identify and formalize security and privacy policies.</b> In order to
      reason about vulnerabilities in software, and ultimately demonstrate
      their absence, we need to agree on what it means for the code to satisfy
      security and privacy requirements. Students will learn how to formalize
      these policies using logical specifications, types, and mathematical
      definitions that give precise meaning to policies.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify">
      <b>Understand formal proof and deductive systems.</b> One of the key
      benefits of formalizing policies is that it becomes possible to conduct
      formal proof of a program's adherence to policy. Formal proofs can be
      checked by automated procedures, and in many cases can be derived
      automatically or with substantial assistance from automated tools.
      Students will understand the properties of deductive systems that lead
      to their useful application in software security, be able to establish
      these properties for novel deductive systems, and be able to conduct a
      formal proof that a piece of software adheres to a security policy.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify">
      <b>Understand how automated software security tools work.</b> Most of
      the tools and techniques that are discussed in this class are not
      perfect, and will never be able to meet all security needs in all
      settings. Understanding the principles and techniques that these tools
      use is necessary for evaluating when it is appropriate to use then, and
      for addressing their limitations in practice.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify">
      However, this is not a "pure" theory course, and much of the intended
      focus is on applying the above principles to real, practical problems
      that arise in software security and privacy.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify">
      <b>Apply rigorous techniques to achieve security and privacy.</b> The
      course will cover numerous techniques for translating the objectives of
      formal policies into practical implementations that meet these
      objectives. Students will learn how to use reference monitors, type
      systems, authorization logic, and state space exploration to ensure that
      implemented code satisfies a given policy.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify">
      <b>Understand trusted computing technologies.</b> Trusted computing and
      related technologies are widely used in practice, and continue to show
      promise in emerging "killer" applications. Students will understand how
      the formal principles underpinning this technology yield practical,
      scalable results through the use of hardware protections and software
      techniques that build on them.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify">
      At all times, the interplay between attack and defense is central to the
      topics covered in this course. We will not spend much time is this
      course writing exploits for known vulnerabilities, but it is often the
      case that in order to design an appropriate defense, intimate knowledge
      of the attacker's design space and toolbox is necessary. Conversely,
      students will learn that once one has formalized a security policy and
      semantics for the system, it becomes easy to identify potential
      vulnerabilities, or to rule out entire classes of potential
      vulnerability. In short, students will not learn specific hacking
      techniques in this course, but will understand how to identify and
      analyze software vulnerabilities for the purpose of designing
      mitigations.

<h3>Assignment Policies</h3>

<p>Please refer to the page on <a href="assignments.html">Assignments</a>.

    <h3>Grading</h3>

    <p>Your final grade will be calculated using the following components:</p>

    <table class="table table-sm">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Component</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Written Homework (40%)</td>
          <td>
            <p>
              Written homework will be assigned more frequently, and should
              not require as much time to complete as the labs. The goal of
              the written homework is to help you refine the fundamental
              skills, and better understand the theoretical underpinnings,
              that you will need in order to do well on the labs and exam.
              Grading for these assignments is based on the correctness of
              your answer, and the presentation of your reasoning. You should
              strive for clarity and conciseness, while making sure to show
              each step of your reasoning. Categorical answers with no
              explanation will not even receive partial credit, but lucid
              explanations of your attempt to find the answer will.
            </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Labs (40%)</td>
          <td>
            <p>
              The lab assignments are designed to give you hands-on experience
              writing secure software or finding vulnerabilities.
              The most important criterion with respect to grading the labs is
              correctness, and your justification for believing that your
              solution is correct. An ideal lab attempt contains a concise,
              correct security policy, and a correct implementation of an
              apparatus that enforces that policy or sufficient documentation of
              the steps you took to ensure compliance. While largely autograded,
              testing is not a guarantee of correctness so there is a human
              component to grading even labs.  It is therefore important that
              the code you hand in be clean and well-commented, as course staff
              cannot assign points to solutions that they do not understand.
              </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Midterm Exam (20%)</td>
          <td>
            <p> We will have only a midterm exam (no final), with the third lab
            taking on added significance. The content of these exams will more
            closely resemble the written homework than the labs, but some
            questions may rely on, or make reference to, key parts of the
            labs. The midterm will take place during the normal class meeting
            time, in the same room used for lectures. The exam is "closed book"
            (i.e., you may not reference our lecture notes or your own notes),
            but we will provide a reference sheet with relevant rules and
            definitions.  </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
